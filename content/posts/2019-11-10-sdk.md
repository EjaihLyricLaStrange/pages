I like to think about how people... think. What drives us to wake up in the morning?
Why this person bought an orange toothbrush? Not white, not red, but orange.
Was it the only one available? Was the orange the tastiest fruit in the person childhood so the color looks tasty?
Was it a beautiful orange bird in the dream that lead to a spark of the emotion behind the choice?
Why do we think that atomic energy is safe enough? Sounds ridiculous, right.

Anyways, how do we choose dependencies? What knowledge backs the decision?
It is not an emotional one for sure.
