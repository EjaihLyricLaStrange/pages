      <description>RxJava 1.x reaches EOL on March 31, 2018, meaning no further development. That’s not surprising since the 1.x was in a bugfix-only mode since June 1, 2017.
This is an interesting event in a software lifetime, since not so many libraries actually live and prosper long enough to produce a superior version, at the same time handling support for an older version for so long. Fortunately enough, RxJava is one of these lucky projects with maintainers actually caring about users.</description>

      <description>I think almost everybody in the CS world knows about the Null References: The Billion Dollar Mistake talk. However, it does not really matter if the concept of null references a good idea or a really bad one. We live in the world where we just have to deal with null this way or another. Yep, just deal with it. So let’s ask the “How” question instead of the “Why” one.</description>
